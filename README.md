 # PyTorch Fundamentals

This repository explores the fundamental concepts of PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. 

## Key Features

- **Tensor Operations:** Create, manipulate, and perform operations on tensors, the core data structures in PyTorch.
- **Automatic Differentiation:** Learn how PyTorch automatically computes gradients, essential for training neural networks.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Build a simple linear regression model with dummy data and visualize the results.
- **Modules and Layers:** Get introduced to building neural networks using `nn.Module` and defining layers.
- **Activation Functions:** Understand the role of Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and Softmax activation functions.
- **Loss Functions:** Explore different loss functions for regression and classification tasks.
